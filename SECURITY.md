# ðŸ”’ Security Checklist

This document outlines the security measures implemented in Synchro and provides guidance for secure deployment.

## âœ… Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Environment Variables
- âœ… All sensitive configuration moved to environment variables
- âœ… `.env` file added to `.gitignore`
- âœ… `.env.example` template provided for setup
- âœ… No hardcoded API keys or credentials in source code

### 2. Firebase Security Rules
- âœ… Comprehensive Firestore security rules implemented
- âœ… Role-based access control (Owner, Member, Viewer)
- âœ… User data isolation (users can only access their own data)
- âœ… Project access restricted to team members only
- âœ… Task access controlled by project membership

### 3. Authentication
- âœ… Firebase Authentication with Google and Email/Password
- âœ… Secure session management
- âœ… User profile data protection

### 4. Data Protection
- âœ… No sensitive data stored in frontend
- âœ… API keys managed through environment variables
- âœ… Secure data transmission (HTTPS)
- âœ… Database-level access control

## ðŸš¨ Security Considerations for Deployment

### Before Making Repository Public:

1. **Verify No Sensitive Data**
   ```bash
   # Check for any remaining API keys or secrets
   grep -r "AIzaSy" . --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git
   grep -r "sk-" . --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git
   grep -r "password" . --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git
   ```

2. **Environment Variables Setup**
   - Ensure all API keys are in environment variables
   - Never commit `.env` files
   - Use `.env.example` as a template

3. **Firebase Configuration**
   - Use environment variables for Firebase config
   - Set up proper Firebase security rules
   - Configure authentication providers

4. **API Key Management**
   - Rotate API keys if they were exposed
   - Use Firebase App Check for additional security
   - Monitor API usage and set up alerts

## ðŸ”§ Security Configuration

### Firebase Security Rules
The application uses comprehensive security rules:

```javascript
// Users can only read/write their own data
match /users/{userId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}

// Projects: only members can read, only owners can edit
match /projects/{projectId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null && 
    request.auth.uid in resource.data.teamMembers;
  allow write: if request.auth != null && 
    request.auth.uid == resource.data.createdBy;
}

// Tasks: only project members can access
match /tasks/{taskId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
    request.auth.uid in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/projects/$(resource.data.projectId)).data.teamMembers;
}
```

### Environment Variables Security
- All sensitive configuration uses environment variables
- No secrets in source code
- Proper `.gitignore` configuration
- Template file for easy setup

## ðŸš€ Deployment Security

### Production Checklist
- [ ] All environment variables configured
- [ ] Firebase security rules deployed
- [ ] API keys rotated if previously exposed
- [ ] HTTPS enabled (automatic with Firebase Hosting)
- [ ] Firebase App Check configured (recommended)
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting set up

### Monitoring
- Set up Firebase monitoring for unusual activity
- Monitor API usage and costs
- Set up alerts for failed authentication attempts
- Track database access patterns

## ðŸ“‹ Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for all configuration
3. **Rotate API keys** regularly
4. **Review security rules** before deployment
5. **Test access controls** thoroughly

### For Users
1. **Use strong passwords** for email authentication
2. **Enable 2FA** where possible
3. **Be cautious** with project invitations
4. **Review team member access** regularly
5. **Report suspicious activity** immediately

## ðŸ†˜ Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **Do not** create a public issue
2. **Email** security concerns to: security@synchro.solutions
3. **Include** detailed information about the vulnerability
4. **Wait** for acknowledgment before public disclosure
